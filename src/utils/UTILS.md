# Utils

This folder is here for anything small that is still useful but doesn't make sense to put anywhere else. Two examples are **helpers** or **formatters**, which serve a specific purpose in your application.

## Some examples

### 1. helpers

This file could have any sort of function that is small, useful and doesn't belong anywhere else. An example could be merging two _objects_ or _arrays_ or you could use a library for this and place it in here as well.

### 2. formatters

This folder is useful to hold things that could need **formatting** such as dates, currencies, etc.
